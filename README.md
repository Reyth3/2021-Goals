# 2021 Goals

This project is my attempt at two things:

1. Learning the Blazor WebAssembly framework and setting up a fullly functional website with it
2. Structuring and visualizing my personal learning path as a .NET developer for 2021

With this project I aim to further my understanding of building responsive web applications with realtime feedback using the Blazor frontend, but also focusing strongly on the ASP.NET Core backend side, which is what I am currently leaning more towards.
